Compute Crown Competition Factor 
\url{https://cmapspublic3.ihmc.us/rid=1N4TSFQX6-GWW4BN-14PZ/Crown\%20competition\%20-\%20A\%20measure\%20of\%20density.pdf}.
Krajicek, J.E., K.A. Brinkman, and F.S. Gingrich.  1961.  Crown competition: a measure of density.  For. Sci. 7:36 â€“ 42.  

Crown competition factor is the ratio of the open-grown crown area of all trees as a percentage of an acre:
\eqn{CCF = 100 \sum{CA}/43560}, 
where CA is the open-grown crown area of a given tree.

The function allows for computing the equivalent index in metric units.
